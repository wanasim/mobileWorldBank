# WorldBank Mobile App Project

This project leverages React-Native to render World Bank information across several topics - Agriculture, Economy, Education, Health, and Infrastructure.

The data is stored in an Oracle Database cloud instance and is being accessed via RESTful APIs through a Node application deployed on an Oracle ACCS instance.

To use the app, please do the following:

* install dependencies (directions here https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `react-native run-android`
